write a python webserver to help me keep track of taking my medicine every day. it should have three buttons, one for morning magnesium, one for morning flonase, one for evening magnesium. It should have a reset button in case I make a mistake. It should reset the buttons at midnight. It should record down each action I take in an external file with the date and time and also show that in the webpage somehow in an intuitive way. Should be mobile and desktop friendly and look nice.
